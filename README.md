# Aurdino-Experiments-
The purpose of this Arduino project is to build and program a rover that can be controlled using various inputs such as buttons, sensors, and other features. 

The project will involve using the Arduino microcontroller to read input data and control the movement and actions of the rover. 

By building and programming this rover, we will gain a deeper understanding of how to use Arduino to control various electronic components and create a fully functional  system. 

Additionally, we will learn how to use sensors to make the rover more responsive to its environment.
